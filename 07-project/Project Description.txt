This is a description of the capstone project submitted towards the requirement of certification from DataTalksClub
on completing MLOps Zoomcamp 2023.
For the project, I have selected publicly available Divvy Bike Sharing dataset provided by Chicago Transportation.
Data Source path
Awesome-public-datasets-> Government-> Chicago-> Transportation-> Divvy Trips
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Trips/fg6s-gzvg
https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data
https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

Possible use cases can be -
1. Given the starting station id and destination station id, predict the time length of the trip.
2. Given starting station and start time, predict the destination station and ETA. 

Since, the course is focused on learning mlops techniques, the project objective is limited to 1st for now.
Watch this space for future updates on 2nd use case
