This project is developed and submitted towards the fulfilment of requirement for certification from DataTalksClub
on completing MLOps Zoomcamp 2023.
I have selected publicly available "Divvy Bike Sharing" dataset provided by Chicago Transportation.
Data Source path - https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html
Awesome-public-datasets-> Government-> Chicago-> Transportation-> Divvy Trips
(https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Trips/fg6s-gzvg)
(https://ride.divvybikes.com/system-data)

Possible use cases can be -
1. Given the starting station id and destination station id, predict the time length of the trip.
2. Given starting station and start time, predict the destination station and ETA. 

Since, the course is focused on learning mlops techniques, the project objective is limited to first use case for now.
Watch this space for future updates on 2nd use case

The columns in the dataset are described below =>
ride_id 	- ride identifier assigned to every bike trip
rideable_type   - whether bike is 'electric_bike' or 'classic_bike' or 'docked_bike'
started_at  	- trip start time
ended_at  	- trip end time
start_station_name - name of the bike station where trip started
start_station_id - identifier for the starting station
end_station_name - name of the bike station where trip ended
end_station_id  - identifier for the ending station
start_lat  	- latitude of the trip starting station
start_lng  	- longitude of the trip starting station
end_lat  	- latitude of the trip ending station
end_lng  	- longitude of the trip ending station
member_casual   - whether bike rider has a membership or it's a casual trip taken by a tourist

New features defined for the use case are =>
trip_duration - computed as time difference between 'ended_at' and 'started_at'
trip_distance - calculated with geopy.distance using (lat,lng) of start and end stations.
